# BuK Abgabe

This repo uses the provided template of our university. I converted it into a
LaTeX Class file so it can be easier used across documents. Additionally I
added a config to extract the variables for the student names and exercise
number.

The original Template as seen in `example.tex` is provided by our university.
I do not hold the copyright for that.
